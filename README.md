# Web App with Python and Flask

Welcome to my repository for the **Web App with Python and Flask** course! This repository contains all the code and resources I created while learning and implementing the concepts covered in the course.

## Course Overview

During this project-based course, I gained hands-on experience in building web applications using Python and Flask. The course focused on achieving the following learning objectives:

- Creating Web Applications with Flask
- Using Templates with Flask Applications
- Implementing WTForms and SQLAlchemy with Flask Applications

By the end of the course, I successfully acquired the skills necessary to develop web applications with Python and Flask.

## Repository Contents

This repository is structured as follows:

- `app.py`: The main Python file containing the code for my web application.
- `templates/`: A directory that stores the HTML templates used in the application.
- `static/`: A directory for static files, such as CSS and JavaScript files.
- `requirements.txt`: A file specifying the Python dependencies required for running the application.

## Project Structure

Throughout the project, I completed various tasks to build a functional web app. The tasks included:

1. Introduction
2. A Minimal App
3. Templates
4. Extending the Templates
5. Forms
6. POST Requests
7. SQLAlchemy
8. Updating and Using the Database
9. A Note on Creating the Database
10. Updating the Templates
11. Edit Route
12. Delete Route

Each task contributed to the overall functionality and features of the web application.
